# Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks Essential Training

## Course details

Take a deep dive into neural networks and convolutional neural networks, two key concepts in the area of machine learning. In this hands-on course, instructor Jonathan Fernandes covers fundamental neural and convolutional neural network concepts. Jonathan begins by providing an introduction to the components of neural networks, discussing activation functions and backpropagation. He then looks at convolutional neural networks, explaining why they're particularly good at image recognition tasks. He also steps through how to build a neural network model using Keras. Plus, learn about VGG16, the history of the ImageNet challenge, and more.

## Notes about the exercise files:

The files here are organized in that the redundant files in the original exercise files folder have been deleted. Furthermore, huge changes to the original exercise files folder are implemented: 
* the weights folder needed in Chapter 5 are moved from Chapter 6;
* the images needed in Chapter 6 for image augmentation are placed in the Chapter 6 folder, and;
* the Jupyter notebook for Chapter 7 (for exploration of the VGG 16 model) has been created.

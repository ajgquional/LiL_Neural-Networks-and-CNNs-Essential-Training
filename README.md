# LiL_Neural-Networks-and-CNNs-Essential-Training
This repository contains the exercise files in the LinkedIn Learning course "Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks Essential Training" by Jonathan Fernandes. The files here are organized in that the redundant files in the original exercise files folder have been deleted. Furthermore, huge changes to the original exercise files folder are implemented: the weights folder needed in Chapter 5 are moved from Chapter 6, the images needed in Chapter 6 for image augmentation are placed in the Chapter 6 folder, and the Jupyter notebook for Chapter 7 (for exploration of the VGG 16 model) is created.
